stdio.h — standard buffered input/output

Some of the functionality described on this reference page
extends the ISO C standard. Applications shall define the
appropriate feature test macro (see the System Interfaces volume
of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 2.2, The Compilation Environment) to
enable the visibility of these symbols in this header.

The <stdio.h> header shall define the following data types
through typedef:

FILE          A structure containing information about a file.

fpos_t        A non-array type containing all information needed
              to specify uniquely every position within a file.

off_t         As described in <sys/types.h>.

size_t        As described in <stddef.h>.

ssize_t       As described in <sys/types.h>.

va_list       As described in <stdarg.h>.

The <stdio.h> header shall define the following macros which
shall expand to integer constant expressions:

BUFSIZ        Size of <stdio.h> buffers.  This shall expand to a
              positive value.

L_ctermid     Maximum size of character array to hold ctermid()
              output.

L_tmpnam      Maximum size of character array to hold tmpnam()
              output.

The <stdio.h> header shall define the following macros which
shall expand to integer constant expressions with distinct
values:

_IOFBF        Input/output fully buffered.

_IOLBF        Input/output line buffered.

_IONBF        Input/output unbuffered.

The <stdio.h> header shall define the following macros which
shall expand to integer constant expressions with distinct
values:

SEEK_CUR      Seek relative to current position.

SEEK_END      Seek relative to end-of-file.

SEEK_SET      Seek relative to start-of-file.

The <stdio.h> header shall define the following macros which
shall expand to integer constant expressions denoting
implementation limits:

{FILENAME_MAX}
              Maximum size in bytes of the longest pathname that
              the implementation guarantees can be opened.

{FOPEN_MAX}   Number of streams which the implementation
              guarantees can be open simultaneously. The value is
              at least eight.

{TMP_MAX}     Minimum number of unique filenames generated by
              tmpnam().  Maximum number of times an application
              can call tmpnam() reliably. The value of {TMP_MAX}
              is at least 25.

              On XSI-conformant systems, the value of {TMP_MAX}
              is at least 10000.

The <stdio.h> header shall define the following macro which shall
expand to an integer constant expression with type int and a
negative value:

EOF           End-of-file return value.

The <stdio.h> header shall define NULL as described in
<stddef.h>.

The <stdio.h> header shall define the following macro which shall
expand to a string constant:

P_tmpdir      Default directory prefix for tempnam().

The <stdio.h> header shall define the following macros which
shall expand to expressions of type ``pointer to FILE'' that
point to the FILE objects associated, respectively, with the
standard error, input, and output streams:

stderr        Standard error output stream.

stdin         Standard input stream.

stdout        Standard output stream.

The following shall be declared as functions and may also be
defined as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.

symbols from <stddef.h>.
