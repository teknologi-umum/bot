Dear <a href="https://twitter.com/colmmacuait">@colmmacuait</a>, I think that if you type "man" at 0001 hours it should print "gimme gimme gimme". <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/abba?src=hash">#abba</a>

er, that was my fault, I suggested it. Sorry.

Pretty much the whole story is in the commit. The maintainer of man is a good friend of mine, and one day six years ago I jokingly said to him that if you invoke man after midnight it should print "<em>gimme gimme gimme</em>", because of the Abba song called "<em>Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight</em>":

Well, he did actually <a href="https://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/man-db.git/commit/src/man.c?id=002a6339b1fe8f83f4808022a17e1aa379756d99">put it</a> <a href="https://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/man-db.git/commit/src/man.c?id=91c495389105a4cb6214fe176f703f498e4f0d91">in</a>. A few people were amused to discover it, and we mostly forgot about it until today.

I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that one turned up eventually, but it did take six years.
